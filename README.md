# Running Low

### Hydrochloric Studio

#### Daniel Grinshpon

This is a game submission for the Ludum Dare 43 jam. The theme is: Sacrifices must be made.

The concept of the game is that you are a stranded robot with limited energy being attacked by rogue units. Your health and ammo share a single energy pool that you must conserve, but also use if you want to live. The idea is that in order to survive, you must sacrifice your health, but you have to be careful. When you run out of energy, you die.
